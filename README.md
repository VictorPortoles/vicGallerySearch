# Instructions
VicGallerySearch allows you to move images easily. 
If you have many images and want to move them one by one carefully, select the folder,
and the program will load all the images visually. When you click on an image, 
it will automatically move to a folder named VicGallerySearch. Once you’ve clicked on the images you’re interested in, 
you can click on Move All To (top right) to move everything inside VicGallerySearch to the folder of your choice.
Support files: Png, Jpeg, Avif, Webp.
